Please, complete the following task.

You will work with this endpoint - https://api.punkapi.com/v2/beers/8
 Need to write 2 tests:

 1. Using requests method GET need to check that:
 * status code - 200
 * name - Fake Lager
 * abv - 4.7

 2. Using requests method DELETE need to check that:
 * status code - 404
 * message - No endpoint found that matches '/v2/beers/8'

 ### Dont forget about requests library

 To install requests use this command - pip install requests
 PSS: I would like to recommend to use page #15 from slides from this lecture;
 small clue - correct using for 1st task will be - .json()[0]['your_key']
