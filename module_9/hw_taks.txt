Homework
Your task is to parse data about the companies from the S&P500 index, which can be found here:
https://markets.businessinsider.com/index/components/s&p_500
For each company gather the information about:
Current company price
Company's code (to the right of the company name on the company page)
P/E of the company (to the right of the graph on the company page)
Year growth/decline of the company (in %) (main table)
Save the information in 3 JSON files
1. Top 10 companies with the most expensive shares.
2. Top 10 companies with the lowest P/E.
3. Top 10 companies with the most growth for the last year
Sample format:
[
{
"code": "MMM",
"name": "3M CO.",
"price" | "P/E" | "growth" : value,
},
...
]
Use the asyncio (with aiohttp) or threading (with requests) to speed up the data fetching
Would be cool to use both approaches and compare them :) Useful libs:
beautifulsoup4 for parsing HTML fetched from the given website
aiohttp as an async HTTP client
httpx
